# social-cc-plugin

Install the **Claude Code for Social Scientists** project skills into your Claude configuration.

This package bundles ten Claude Code project skills that turn the booklets in
[claude-code-for-social-scientists](https://github.com/TheGoatPsy/claude-code-for-social-scientists)
into repeatable, auditable workflows for academic work: literature triage, APA 7 DOI verification,
bilingual booklet pairing, AI disclosure auditing, ethics and IRB protocols, rebuttal traceability,
research vault architecture, regional academic access, agentic session debugging, and pre-release
repository integrity checks.

## Install

```bash
pip install social-cc-plugin
social-cc install
```

`social-cc install` copies the skills into `~/.claude/skills/`. Use `social-cc install --project` to
write them into the current project's `.claude/skills/` directory instead, `--dry-run` to preview
without writing, and `--force` to overwrite existing skill directories. `social-cc list` shows what
is bundled.

## What the skills do

The skills carry repeatable operating protocols, not new scholarly content. Each skill states when
to use it, expected inputs, a workflow, an output format, verification checks, and explicit safety
boundaries. They never request credentials, never bypass paywalls or access controls, and never
invent citations.
